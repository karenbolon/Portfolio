# [Project 1: GIFs of Fertility Rate vs Life Expectancy](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_01_project)

* Collected data from gapminder project (https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
* Used pandas to import and merge data 
* Created GIF using Seaborn and ImageIO




# [Project 2: Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster (Predicting Survival Rates)](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_02_project)

* Collected data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
* Built and compared a variety of Machine Learning classifiers with scikit-learn (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest) to predict survival of passengers on the Titanic
* Project consisted of all phases of Machine Learning work-flow (train-test-splitting of data, data exploration, feature engineering, optimization of hyperparameters, evaluation of models with cross-validation)
