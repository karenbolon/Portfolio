# [Project 1: GIFs of Fertility Rate vs Life Expectancy](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/Gapminder_Analysis_GIF_Project)

* Collected data from gapminder project (https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
* Used pandas to import and merge data 
* Created GIF using Seaborn and ImageIO

# [Project 2: Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster (Predicting Survival Rates)](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_02_project)

* Collected data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
* Built and compared a variety of Machine Learning classifiers with scikit-learn (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest) to predict survival of passengers on the Titanic
* Project consisted of all phases of Machine Learning work-flow (train-test-splitting of data, data exploration, feature engineering, optimization of hyperparameters, evaluation of models with cross-validation)

A graph showing those that survived vs perished by age.

# [Project 3: Capital Bike Sharing](https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_03_project)]

* Built and trained a regression model on the Capital Bike Share (Washington, D.C.) Kaggle data set (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/data), in order to predict demand for bicycle rentals at any given hour, based on time and weather
* Imported and cleaned data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), using Pandas for Time Series Analysis

* Performed Data Engineering using Pipelines, ColumnTransformer, OneHotEncoder, MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, and RobustScaler
* Trained regression models (Random Forest Regression, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression with Cross Validation) to find the best Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE)  
* Used ElasticNet to regularise the model
* Used Hyperparameter Optimization on Random Forest Regression Model and GridSearchCV

# [Project 4: Text Classification with Webscraping] (https://github.com/spicedacademy/fenugreek-student-code/tree/karen/week_04_project)

* Built a text classification model on song lyrics, the following was performed: 
-download an HTML page with links to songs (https://www.lyrics.com)
-Extract hyperlinks of songs to download and extract song lyrics
-Vectorize the text using the Bag Of Words method and normalised the word counts with term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)
-train a classification model (logistic regression model) that predicts the artist from a piece of text
